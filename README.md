# Vanilla Todo App
### Please feel free to contribute! 
>Since we have migrated to Typescript, please make your code changes in the app.ts file instead of the app.js file so we can compile the Typescript changes accordingly.
### If you see any issues/bugs or just cool features you'd like to add, please submit an Issue or Pull Request.

Open to ideas! Let's have fun and code together!

**To get the app running, please compile the app.ts Typescript file using tsc:**

`tsc app.ts`

This will create the app.js file for you that is already referenced in the index.html file so your javascript will now run.
